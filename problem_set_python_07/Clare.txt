Clare by Shel Silverstein

Clare loves me,
Clare cares,
Clare picks me peaches and pears.
Clare offers me candy and Cokes,
Clare listens and laughs at me jokes.
Clare helps when I get in a fight,
Clare does all my homework at night.
Clare misses me,
Clare cries,
Clare thinks I'm a wonderful guy.
So if you ask me who's my best friend, in a whiz,
I'll stand up and tell you that Clare is.
But yesterday night I got quite a scare,
I woke up and Clare just wasn't there.
I called out and reached out for Clare's hand,
In the darkness where Clare usually stands.
Then I poked through the house, in each cranny and nook,
But I found somebody each place that I looked.
I searched till I'm tired, and now with the dawn,
There's no doubt about it-
Clare's gone!
